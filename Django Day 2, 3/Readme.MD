# Django Day 2 and Day 3 Code
This repository has the code of the sesssions taken on 11th and 12th February.
- ```mysite``` is a basic example of how ```views.py, urls.py and django templating``` works.
- ```myapp``` is an example of how ```forms.py, models.py, admin.py, views.py, urls.py and django templating``` works. 
This is more relatable to the development progress in Django.
